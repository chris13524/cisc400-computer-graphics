First we define an init function. This function gets our
canvas object. If there was no canvas, it logs the error
and aborts. Otherwise it continues to get the WebGL
context. It displays a JavaScript alert dialog saying
whether or not the context was available.

Next, we set the init function to run after the page loads.
